For a RAINMAKER based app

sdkconfig bluetooth should have bluetooth enable and just be Nimble-BLE Only else size does not fit in 4MB Flash
the partitions shoulb be two toas or copy this

# Name,   Type, SubType, Offset,  Size, Flags
# Note: Firmware partition offset needs to be 64K aligned, initial 36K (9 sectors) are reserved for bootloader and partition table
sec_cert,  0x3F, ,0xd000,    0x3000, ,  # Never mark this as an encrypted partition

better do a build to get access to a Terminal with idf.py. If errors no matter.

RStart at the Project ROOT Directory

git clone --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-rainmaker.git

then get from <esp-rainmaker> folder take the <components> to the root directory of the  project. 
Then take out from the esp-rainmaker folder <examples> folder get the <common> folder and put in the <components> folder 
Delete esp-rainmaker folder now useless

In the root folder cmakelstis.txt add
set(EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS components/common/app_wifi components/common/app_reset)

Fastled install in ROOT folder of project
git clone --recursive https://github.com/bbulkow/FastLED-idf.git
open <FastLED-idf> and move from <components>FastLED-idf inside the root <components> folder
delete FastLed-idf folder 

SSD1306 via u8g2 installing the component
in <component> folder of project  +++++pwd must point to components+++++
git clone --recursive https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2.git

then in a Terminal from the VSC (access to idf.py) do a 
idf.py reconfigure

clean, configure if necessary skdconfig
build and flash

frequency was tested upto 72000hz and WORKED!!! just fyi

the standard app_wifi does not have a call to start provisioning with a User/Password defined vars.
In Garage version, copy the commom/app_wifi if you want that and change in main app at the end the call to the app
    err = app_wifi_start(POP_TYPE_RANDOM); 
    to
    err = app_wifi_start(POP_TYPE_RANDOM,(char*)"PROV_RSN",(char *)"csttpstt");

    as is the case in this version

For u8g2 in components dir
git clone https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2.git
git clone https://github.com/mkfrey/u8g2-hal-esp-idf.git
